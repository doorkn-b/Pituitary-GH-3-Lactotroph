# Pituitary-GH-3-Lactotroph
This repository contains the original model for a Pituatary GH3 cell. [Wu and Chang 2005](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel?model=62272&file=/GH3_Katp/readme.html#tabs-1)

Diethyl pyrocarbonate, a histidine-modifying agent, directly stimulates activity of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pituitary GH3 cells.

The results indicate that chemical 
modification with DEPC enhances K(ATP)-channel activity and 
influences functional activities of pituitary GH(3) cells.

To run the models:
XPP: start with the command

```
xpp ode\GH3_Katp
```

Mouse click on Initialconds, and then (G)o.
This makes a trace similar to fig 7 of the paper:

Regarding the xpp program, please visit [Bard Ermentrout's website](https://sites.pitt.edu/~phase/)
 which describes how to get and use xpp (Bard wrote xpp).
